1. Agile
Story 1: 
As a vanilla git power-user that has never seen GiggleGit before, I want to understand the merging process. This is so I can merge my chages.

Story 2:
As a team lead onboarding an experienced GiggleGit user, I want to have secure autherization. This way our company's information is secure from others.

Create a third user story, one task for this user story, and two associated tickets.
Story 3: 
As an admin who needs to manage and oversee multiple GiggleGit users, I want to know how deal with multiple merges at once. This is to avoid issues when multiple people need to work on a project.
Task 1: Set up way to resolve merge conflicts.
Ticket 1: Set up branch functionality when new commit differs from existing commit.
    Details: Add a way for GiggleGit to analyze files to ensure that the files have conflicts before prompting merge conflict issues.
Ticket 2: Test adding commits from different accounts
    Details: Try committing on different accounts to see if the progfram detetcts the issues with different tests

This is not a user story. Why not? What is it?

As a user I want to be able to authenticate on a new machine 

No this is not a user story because user stories "contain both a description of how the customer plans to interact with the system to achieve a specific goal and a description of what the customerâ€™s definition of acceptance is" This is NOT a user story because it mentions a goal, but not what the customer's definition of acceptance is. 

2. Formal Requirements
1 Goal: PMs should be able to create ways to manually create the syncs to ensure content is easily accessible and adjustable for future user studies.

1 Non-goal: Allow for syncs to be completed through the use of memes or images

Non-Functional Requirement 1: Security
1. implement authentication system
2. all user data is to be encrypted and stored safely 

Non-Functional Requirement 2: random assignments of users for user study 
1. Assign users to control group or variant groups as they join a user study, have a fair chance of being either
2. Log the users in each group and the effects for the study
